Local desktop app that automatically mosaics faces in your photos. Drop in images or folders, pick a model, get anonymized copies — nothing ever leaves your machine.

## Install

Download from [Releases](https://github.com/nyattic/FaceVeil/releases/latest):

- **macOS** (Apple Silicon, macOS 12+) — open the `.dmg`, drag to Applications
- **Windows** (x64, Windows 10+) — unzip, run `FaceVeil.exe`

## Use

1. Drop images or folders onto the window
2. Pick a model — **Fast** or **Accurate**
3. Choose an output folder
4. Click **Start**

Originals are never modified. Enable **Review each image** to inspect detections before saving, exclude false positives, add missed faces, leave an image unsaved, or explicitly copy the original.

FaceVeil refuses to start if two inputs would write to the same output path, so existing results are not silently overwritten.

Supported inputs: `.jpg` `.jpeg` `.png` `.bmp` `.tif` `.tiff` `.webp`.

## Build from source

Requires CMake 3.24+, a C++20 compiler, Qt 6 available to CMake, OpenCV 4, ONNX Runtime, spdlog, and SCRFD ONNX model files.

Put SCRFD models in `models/` before running the app, for example:

- `models/2.5g_bnkps.onnx` — Fast
- `models/10g_bnkps.onnx` — Accurate

Model files are not committed to this repository. You can also launch the app and use **Browse…** to select a custom SCRFD `.onnx` file.

Only load custom ONNX models from sources you trust. FaceVeil checks basic SCRFD tensor compatibility before processing, but ONNX files are still executable model inputs handled by native runtime libraries.

### macOS

```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
open build/FaceVeil.app
```

Install dependencies with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install cmake qt opencv onnxruntime spdlog
```

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
cmake -S . -B build-windows -G Ninja `
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release `
  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="C:\Qt\6.11.0\msvc2022_64;C:\opencv\build" `
  -DONNXRUNTIME_ROOT="C:\onnxruntime-win-x64-1.24.4"
cmake --build build-windows --config Release
```

spdlog must also be discoverable by CMake — for example install it with [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io) (`vcpkg install spdlog`) and add the vcpkg entries to `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`.

### Tests

```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

No network calls. Images are read from disk, processed locally, and written to the output folder you pick.
