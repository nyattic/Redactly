Local desktop app that automatically redacts faces and license plates in your photos and videos. Drop in images, videos, or folders, choose what to detect, get anonymized copies — your files are processed entirely on your machine and never uploaded.

The interface is available in English, Korean, Japanese, and Simplified Chinese. The initial language follows the system locale and can be changed at any time in Settings.

> **Renamed from Redactly:** CloakFrame imports existing settings on first launch and continues to use models already downloaded by earlier releases.

## Install

Download from [Releases](https://github.com/nyattic/CloakFrame/releases/latest):

- **macOS** (Apple Silicon, macOS 15+) — open the `.dmg`, drag to Applications
- **Windows** (x64, Windows 10+) — unzip, run `CloakFrame.exe`. GPU acceleration needs Windows 10 1903+ and a DirectX 12 capable GPU (NVIDIA, AMD, or Intel); without one, detection runs on the CPU.
- **Linux** (x86_64) — download the `.AppImage`, `chmod +x` it, and run it

The first time you use a built-in model, CloakFrame downloads it once (3–17 MB) and caches it; after that it runs offline. The face models come from Hugging Face; the license plate model comes from the open-image-models project on GitHub.

## Use

1. Drop images, videos, or folders onto the window
2. Choose what to detect — **Faces**, **License plates**, or **both**
3. For faces, pick a model — **Fast** or **Accurate**
4. Choose an output folder
5. Click **Start**

Faces and plates can be hidden with pixelation, Gaussian blur, solid fill, or a custom image you select. Custom images are resized over each detected region and processed locally. Their transparency is preserved, so transparent pixels leave the original image visible.

Originals are never modified. Enable **Review before saving** to inspect image detections, add missed regions, or review video tracks on a timeline before encoding. False video tracks can be excluded from the entire output with one click.

CloakFrame refuses to start if two inputs would write to the same output path or if any planned output already exists, so results are never silently overwritten. Move or rename existing results before running the same batch again.

When every item is processed and redacted successfully, the run finishes as **Done**. If any file fails, is skipped, or is saved without a detected region, CloakFrame finishes as **Review required** and shows a summary. Treat that state as incomplete, use the activity log to identify the affected files, and inspect them before sharing.

Supported inputs: `.jpg` `.jpeg` `.png` `.bmp` `.tif` `.tiff` `.webp` images, and `.mp4` `.mov` `.m4v` videos (H.264/HEVC, 8-bit SDR). Video support is currently in **beta** — check the output before sharing it. On Linux the video pipeline is covered by automated tests but has not been manually tested yet.

Detection runs on the GPU where available — CoreML on macOS, DirectML on Windows (bundled with the release and accelerating NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel GPUs alike), CUDA on NVIDIA Linux systems, and MIGraphX on supported AMD Linux systems — with automatic CPU fallback and a Settings toggle (on by default). Linux GPU detection requires a source build linked against a GPU-enabled ONNX Runtime; the current AppImage uses CPU inference.

Videos are processed in two passes — detection with bidirectional tracking, then encoding — so faces stay covered through motion blur and brief occlusions. When review is enabled, CloakFrame pauses between the passes to show a track timeline. Encoding uses the GPU's hardware encoder when one works — NVENC or Quick Sync on Windows and Linux, VideoToolbox on macOS — falling back to CPU x264/x265 otherwise or when GPU acceleration is off in Settings. Output is an H.264 (default) or HEVC MP4, selectable in Settings, with the original audio (re-encoded to AAC only when the source codec doesn't fit MP4), container metadata removed, and rotation baked into the pixels. Variable frame rate input is converted to a constant frame rate; 10-bit/HDR input is rejected rather than silently degraded. Video processing uses an FFmpeg bundled next to the app when present, otherwise an FFmpeg found on `PATH`. The video quality preset lives in Settings.

## Build from source

Requires CMake 3.24+, a C++20 compiler, Qt 6.8.1+ available to CMake (with the Linguist tools for UI translations; Qt Svg is optional and gives a crisp settings icon, falling back to a glyph without it), OpenCV 4.10.0 or newer (including OpenCV 5.x), ONNX Runtime, spdlog, and Exiv2 (optional, for metadata preservation). Linux and Windows release builds use Qt 6.10.3 and OpenCV 4.13.0. macOS builds use the latest stable Homebrew packages available when the workflow runs, while rolling-release development systems may also use OpenCV 5.x. FFmpeg is not a build dependency, but video processing needs `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` at runtime (bundled next to the app, or on `PATH`). The detection models (SCRFD for faces, YOLOv9 for license plates) are not build dependencies — the app downloads them on first use, or you can pre-place them (see below).

The built-in models are **not bundled** and **not committed** to this repository. The app downloads them on first use (with an integrity check) and caches them under the platform data directory. To pre-place them for offline use, drop them in `models/`:

- `models/2.5g_bnkps.onnx` — Fast (faces)
- `models/10g_bnkps.onnx` — Accurate (faces)
- `models/yolo-v9-t-512-license-plates-end2end.onnx` — License plates

You can also launch the app and use **Browse…** to select a custom SCRFD `.onnx` file.

Only load custom ONNX models from sources you trust. CloakFrame checks basic SCRFD tensor compatibility before processing, but ONNX files are still executable model inputs handled by native runtime libraries.

### macOS

```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
open build/CloakFrame.app
```

Install dependencies with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install cmake qt opencv onnxruntime spdlog exiv2
```

The application still builds when Qt Linguist Tools are unavailable, but only the English interface is embedded. Check the CMake configure output for `Qt6LinguistTools`; if it is not found, install a Qt distribution that includes the Linguist Tools and reconfigure the build directory before testing the Korean, Japanese, or Simplified Chinese interface.

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
cmake -S . -B build-windows -G Ninja `
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release `
  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="C:\Qt\6.10.3\msvc2022_64;C:\opencv\build" `
  -DONNXRUNTIME_ROOT="C:\onnxruntime-directml-1.24.4"
cmake --build build-windows --config Release
```

spdlog must also be discoverable by CMake — for example install it with [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io) (`vcpkg install spdlog`) and add the vcpkg entries to `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`.

Any ONNX Runtime build works for development, but official Windows releases use the DirectML build so detection runs on the GPU: the `Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime.DirectML` NuGet package staged into an `include`/`lib` layout, with `DirectML.dll` from the `Microsoft.AI.DirectML` package placed next to `onnxruntime.dll` (see the Windows job in `.github/workflows/release.yml`). `scripts/package_windows.ps1` refuses to package without `DirectML.dll`.

### Linux

The Linux CI and AppImage release baseline is Ubuntu 26.04 with Qt 6.10.3, OpenCV 4.13.0, and ONNX Runtime 1.27.1. Install the system build dependencies with:

```bash
sudo apt install cmake ninja-build build-essential pkg-config \
  libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libtiff-dev libwebp-dev libspdlog-dev libexiv2-dev
```

Install Qt 6.10.3 and OpenCV 4.13.0 separately when the distribution packages are older. The pinned source-build configuration used for releases is in [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml).

ONNX Runtime is detected via `pkg-config libonnxruntime` when available; otherwise point CMake at an ONNX Runtime release:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DONNXRUNTIME_ROOT=/path/to/onnxruntime-linux-x64
cmake --build build
./build/CloakFrame
```

On Arch Linux, install the CPU development environment with:

```bash
yay -S --needed base-devel cmake ninja pkgconf qt6-base qt6-tools qt6-svg \
  opencv onnxruntime-cpu spdlog exiv2 ffmpeg
```

Arch Linux currently provides OpenCV 5 through the official `opencv` package. It is supported directly; a separate `opencv4` AUR package is not required for development.

For NVIDIA GPU inference on AVX2-capable systems, replace `onnxruntime-cpu` with `onnxruntime-opt-cuda`:

```bash
yay -S --needed onnxruntime-opt-cuda
```

For supported AMD GPUs, use the MIGraphX-enabled ROCm package instead:

```bash
yay -S --needed onnxruntime-rocm
```

The ONNX Runtime variants conflict, so install only one. Reconfigure the CMake build directory after changing variants. CloakFrame selects CUDA first, then MIGraphX, accepts the legacy ROCm execution provider from ONNX Runtime versions before 1.23, and falls back to CPU when provider initialization or model warmup fails.

### Tests

```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

The video I/O tests exercise a real FFmpeg round trip and are skipped when FFmpeg is not installed.

Out-of-tree CMake directories matching `build*/` are ignored by Git, as are local ONNX models, generated output, package artifacts, incomplete downloads, logs, and common IDE files. Source files, workflows, translations, assets, and documentation remain tracked.

Packaging scripts: [`scripts/package_macos.sh`](scripts/package_macos.sh), [`scripts/package_windows.ps1`](scripts/package_windows.ps1), [`scripts/package_linux.sh`](scripts/package_linux.sh), [`scripts/notarize_macos.sh`](scripts/notarize_macos.sh).

## Privacy

Your images and videos never leave your device — they are read from disk, processed locally (video encoding runs through a local FFmpeg process), and written to the output folder you pick. CloakFrame makes only two kinds of network request, and neither sends any image or personal data: a one-time download of a detection model the first time you use each built-in model — the face models from Hugging Face, or the license plate model from the open-image-models project on GitHub — and a check at launch against the GitHub Releases API to see whether a newer version exists. The update check can be turned off under **Settings → Check for updates on startup**. Supplying a custom SCRFD model with **Browse…** avoids downloading a built-in face model; license plate detection still requires its separate model.

**SCRFD models** — the built-in models are **not distributed with CloakFrame**; the app downloads them on first use from a [Hugging Face mirror](https://huggingface.co/RuteNL/SCRFD-face-detection-ONNX). They originate from [InsightFace](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface) and are available for **non-commercial research use only**, under their own terms separate from the application license (the mirror's Apache-2.0 tag does not override InsightFace's terms). See the [InsightFace Model Zoo](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface/blob/master/model_zoo/README.md) for details.

**License plate model** — the built-in license plate detector is **not distributed with CloakFrame**; the app downloads it on first use from the [open-image-models](https://github.com/ankandrew/open-image-models) project by ankandrew, which is MIT-licensed. It is a YOLOv9-architecture model (see [Citation](#citation)) and is downloaded at runtime and cached locally, under its upstream project's terms. Confirm the current terms with the open-image-models project before any commercial or redistribution use.

**Third-party runtime dependencies** — Qt (LGPL-3.0 / GPL-3.0 / commercial), OpenCV (Apache-2.0), ONNX Runtime (MIT), DirectML (proprietary Microsoft license permitting redistribution; bundled with Windows releases only, as `DirectML.dll`), Exiv2 (GPL-2.0-or-later) with its own dependencies (Brotli, Expat, inih, zlib, GNU gettext), spdlog and {fmt} (MIT), and FFmpeg (LGPL-2.1-or-later with optional GPL components), which is invoked as a separate process for video decoding and encoding. Each retains its own license; the full texts are in [THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt) and are bundled with each release.
